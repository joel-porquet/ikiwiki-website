[[!meta title="Talks and writing"]]

I like presenting, and as painful as the experience usually is in the moment, I
also enjoy writing.

# Writing

In the summer of 2015, I wrote a series of articles for
[LWN.net](https://lwn.net):
* [Porting Linux to a new processor architecture, part 1: The
  basics](https://lwn.net/Articles/654783/)
* [Porting Linux to a new processor architecture, part 2: The early
  code](https://lwn.net/Articles/656286/)
* [Porting Linux to a new processor architecture, part 3: To the finish
  line](https://lwn.net/Articles/657939/)


In October 2015, I reported at [Kernel Recipes
2015](https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2015/) for [LWN.net](https://lwn.net):
* [Speeding up kernel development with QEMU](https://lwn.net/Articles/660404/)

# Talks

In April 2016, I gave a talk at [Embedded Linux Conference
2016](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference) about
Porting Linux to a new processor architecture. This talk goes farther then the
LWN.net articles and the KR'2015 presentation, since I spend some time talking
about SMP and NUMA support.
