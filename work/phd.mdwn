# Abstract

This thesis presents the multi-compartment approach. This approach enables a
secure and flexible co-hosting of multiple autonomous software stacks within a
same multiprocessor system-on-a-chip. In the field of multimedia oriented
consumer devices, such autonomous software stacks generally represent the
assets of the different stakeholders. These stakeholders, chips and set-top
boxes manufacturers, network operators, content providers and customers, do not
necessarily trust each other. Hence, the requirement to find a means to execute
those software stacks together, while enforcing a certain degree of isolation.
Multimedia chips are heavily heterogeneous -- a few general purpose processors
are assisted by numerous specialized processors or coprocessors -- and follow a
shared memory policy. These hardware specificities make it difficult, and even
impossible, to solve this problematic with recent co-hosting techniques only
(e.g. virtualization). The multi-compartment approach consists in a new trust
model, more flexible and generic than the current ones. It allows various
software stacks to run securely and simultaneously on heterogeneous hardware
platforms. In particular, the core of the proposed approach is composed of a
global mechanism for protection. Such a mechanism is responsible for the secure
sharing of the single address space and is placed within the interconnect to
ensure the best control. The multi-compartment approach also presents solutions
for sharing peripheral devices, and more precisely DMA capable devices, among
software stacks. Finally, the approach introduces solutions for the hardware
interrupts redirection problem, a collateral aspect to the peripheral devices
sharing. The main building blocks of the proposed hardware and software
solutions are implemented along with the conception of an experimental
platform, under the form of a virtual prototype. In addition to validating the
approach, the platform is measured in terms of cost, performance and hardware
surface. Considering both aspects, the obtained results show the cost is
negligible.

# Technical

Even if most of my Ph.D. practical work is unfortunately protected by a NDA
with STMicroelectronics, I can still mention that I made great use of two
awesome academic projects, namely [SoCLib](http://www.soclib.fr/) and
[MutekH](http://www.mutekh.org/).

SoCLib is an open platform for virtual prototyping of multiprocessor
systems-on-chip. Basically, it is a set of SystemC models along with a smart
build system, for building simple and complex simulation systems. Using SoCLib,
I developed a MIPS-based multiprocessor and multicluster system-on-chip model,
including the security module I proposed in my Ph.D. You can find my
contributions to SoCLib
[here](http://www.soclib.fr/trac/dev/search?q=joel&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&ticket=on&wiki=on)
and
[there](http://www.soclib.fr/trac/dev/search?q=porquet&noquickjump=1&changeset=on&ticket=on&wiki=on)
(I committed changes under several different names and Trac does not seem to
support OR in searches).

MutekH is a free exokernel-based operating system for embedded systems. I
developed a few modules for MutekH over the course of my Ph.D. and after. The
biggest module I added was a dynamic ELF loader (for MIPS). It allowed me to
dynamically load user applications, which was needed for my Ph.D. work (or
maybe not... but it was fun to do it anyway!), instead of having in-kernel
applications only as MutekH usually operates. In addition to this
[libelf](http://www.mutekh.org/trac/mutekh/browser/hg/libelf), I also developed
a module, named
[libdsrl](http://www.mutekh.org/trac/mutekh/browser/hg/libdsrl), that offered a
LUA interface for scripting applications launching. It was very useful for
describing and launching complex data-flow applications, composed of several
threads communicating via software channels. Find the list of my contributions
to MutekH [here](http://www.mutekh.org/trac/mutekh/wiki/Contributors).
