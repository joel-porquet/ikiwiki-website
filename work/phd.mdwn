# Abstract

This thesis presents the multi-compartment approach. This approach enables a
secure and flexible co-hosting of multiple autonomous software stacks within a
same multiprocessor system-on-a-chip. In the field of multimedia oriented
consumer devices, such autonomous software stacks generally represent the
assets of the different stakeholders. These stakeholders, chips and set-top
boxes manufacturers, network operators, content providers and customers, do not
necessarily trust each other. Hence, the requirement to find a means to execute
those software stacks together, while enforcing a certain degree of isolation.
Multimedia chips are heavily heterogeneous -- a few general purpose processors
are assisted by numerous specialized processors or coprocessors -- and follow a
shared memory policy. These hardware specificities make it difficult, and even
impossible, to solve this problematic with recent co-hosting techniques only
(e.g. virtualization). The multi-compartment approach consists in a new trust
model, more flexible and generic than the current ones. It allows various
software stacks to run securely and simultaneously on heterogeneous hardware
platforms. In particular, the core of the proposed approach is composed of a
global mechanism for protection. Such a mechanism is responsible for the secure
sharing of the single address space and is placed within the interconnect to
ensure the best control. The multi-compartment approach also presents solutions
for sharing peripheral devices, and more precisely DMA capable devices, among
software stacks. Finally, the approach introduces solutions for the hardware
interrupts redirection problem, a collateral aspect to the peripheral devices
sharing. The main building blocks of the proposed hardware and software
solutions are implemented along with the conception of an experimental
platform, under the form of a virtual prototype. In addition to validating the
approach, the platform is measured in terms of cost, performance and hardware
surface. Considering both aspects, the obtained results show the cost is
negligible.
