# Things to do around the world

Knowing a city (e.g. its best restaurants, its cheapest bars, the underground
activities it offers, etc.) takes time. It also often requires meeting the
right people who will tell you where to go and what to do, which you won't find
on tripadvisor or in a guidebook. Here are my compilations of things to do in
different cities around the world that I was lucky enough to discover:
