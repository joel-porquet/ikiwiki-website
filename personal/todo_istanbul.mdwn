[[!meta title="Things to do in Istanbul, Turkey"]]

# Where to live

Downtown Istanbul is basically divided in three parts, because of the rivers.
In the East, there is Sultanahmet which is the historical quarter; in the
North, there is Beyoğlu with the famous Taksim Square; and in the West, on the
Asian side, there is Kadıköy.

Kadıköy is a great place to be, with lots of restaurants and bars and way less
touristy than the other neighborhoods. And it also costs way cheaper on Airbnb!

Transportation stays easy thanks to all the available boats at the Kadıköy pier
(e.g. every 20 minutes to Eminonü/Sultanahmet).

# Where to eat

* **Çiya** in Kadıköy: it is slightly touristy but is also a fav for locals.
  Delicious cold *mezzes* (sold by weight) and hot side dishes and kebab.

* **Kadı Nimet Balıkçısı** in Kadıköy: restaurant hidden right in the middle of
  the fish market.

# Where to have a drink

* Go on **Kadife Sokak** in Kadıköy (or as they call it, *Barlar Sokak* which
  means *Bar Street*) at night and enjoy a beer. Apparently, one of the best
  bars of the street is **Karga** but I have never been able to find it...

* Still in Kadıköy, there is a pub called **Zeplin**. Lots of people at night,
  and huge selection of international beer!

* There are a few rooftop bars, especially in Beyoğlu, with a nice view on the
  city. I went to the **Gradiva Hotel**, which was right next to the Karaköy
  pier, and although it was nice enough I am pretty sure it is not the best
  option out there.

# What to do during the day

Should I even mention the classics? Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Basilica Cistern
and Topkapı Palace in the Sultanahmet quarter, Taksim Square in Beyoğlu.

Less classic things (although still quite touristy of course):

* Take a long walk in Kadıköy and go down to Moda and its nice waterfront.
* Go to the hamam, for example at the **Aziziye Hamam** in Kadıköy. It is quite
  cheap (40 TL for entrance and scrub/massage) but even though they have a nice
  english website, be aware that nobody speaks English there!
* Go to Princes' Islands, by taking a boat from Kadıköy. There are a few boats
  a day. I have never been able to get there though, since I was on the boat on
  quite a stormy day and the captain decided to go back after ten minutes at
  sea.

# Misc

You definitely want to buy a Istanbulkart for transportation. It is around 10
TL and will greatly facilitates your traveling through the city (and will even
allow you to use public bathroom!)

Do not go to western-like malls in Istanbul, it is really not worth wasting
your time. The prices are the same as in France, in my case, and the stores are
exactly the same as well.
