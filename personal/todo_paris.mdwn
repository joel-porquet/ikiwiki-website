[[!meta title="Things to do in Paris, France"]]

Non-exhaustive list of bars and restaurants in Paris, ordered by
arrondissement.

# 1st arrondissement

## Chatelet - Les halles

* One of the cheapest (but not necessarily the best one though) *Bo Bun* in
  Paris, at **Delices City** .
* Want to eat a 1kg piece of meat for your birthday and pay the price of your
  age? Then go to **Black Dog**.

## Opera - Rue Saint Anne

Rue Saint Anne is one of the most famous streets for real Japanese food. All
the restaurants are usually open all day, which is quite convenient for a late
lunch on a Saturday.

* **Higuma**, usually pretty crowded.
* **Hokkaido**, less crowded but still delicious.

# 5th arrondissement

* **L'arbre à Cannelle** has good stuff for brunch albeit slightly expensive.
* **Mekong** has the best Bo Bun ever, and very cheap! Crowded at lunch time
  during the week, less so at night for dinner.
* **Foyer Vietnamien** has good Asian food. Since it is managed by volunteers,
  it is quite cheap. Also don't be afraid to enter, even though it does not
  necessarily look like a restaurant from the outside...

# 6th arrondissement

* **Japorama - Auberge des deux dragons** is one of my favorite sushi
  restaurants. Not too expensive and good.

# 9th arrondissement

* Want to live a typical Parisian experience in an old looking restaurant? Then
  go to **Chez Chartier**, it is perfect for when you want to impress foreign
  friends coming to visit. There is usually a line, but it does not take too
  long to get in.

# 10th arrondissement

* My favorite north-Indian restaurant (i.e. meat curries, rice and
  chapatis/naans) in Paris, at **Sheezan**.
* A south-Indian restaurant, also present in India and in the US (they are a
  small chain), near Gare du Nord, at **Saravanaa Bhavan**.

# 11th arrondissement

* **Kim and Kim** is a small Korean restaurant, near where I used to live.

# 13th arrondissement

* **Pho 13** has a really good and cheap Phở.
* In the same street, there is also **Pho 14** which is supposed to have the
  best Phở in Paris (but in my opinion, it's less good than Pho 13).

# 20th arrondissement

* **L'abri-bus** has cheap moritos, and good food for lunch or dinner.
