[[!meta title="Things to do in Paris, France"]]

Non-exhaustive list of bars and restaurants in Paris, ordered by
arrondissement.

# 1st arrondissement

## Chatelet - Les halles

* Want to eat a 1kg piece of meat for your birthday and pay the price of your
  age? Then go to [Black Dog](http://goo.gl/maps/71tGn).

## Opera - Rue Saint Anne

Rue Saint Anne is one of the most famous streets for real Japanese food. All
the restaurants are usually open all day, which is quite convenient for a late
lunch on a Saturday.

* [Higuma](http://goo.gl/maps/u5Ldt), usually pretty crowded.
* [Hokkaido](http://goo.gl/maps/hVQAS), less crowded but still delicious.

# 5th arrondissement

* [L'arbre à Cannelle](http://goo.gl/maps/9kCMM) has good stuff for brunch
  albeit slightly expensive.
* [Mekong](http://goo.gl/maps/Vd5bv) has the best Bo Bun ever, and very cheap!
  Crowded at lunch time during the week, less so at night for dinner.
* [Foyer Vietnamien](http://goo.gl/maps/tsCwj) has good Asian food. Since it is
  managed by volunteers, it is quite cheap. Also don't be afraid to enter, even
  though it does not necessarily look like a restaurant from the outside...

# 6th arrondissement

* [Japorama - Auberge des deux dragons](http://goo.gl/maps/qPrjx) is one of my
  favorite sushi restaurants. Not too expensive and good.

* [Fish (la boissonnerie)](http://goo.gl/maps/usyQX) is an excellent
  high-standard restaurant, installed in an former fish shop. Stays open quite
  late for lunch, and reasonable price for a complete menu (~30€).

# 9th arrondissement

* Want to live a typical Parisian experience in an old looking restaurant? Then
  go to [Chez Chartier](http://goo.gl/maps/rW1Wf), it is perfect for when you
  want to impress foreign friends coming to visit. There is usually a line, but
  it does not take too long to get in.

# 10th arrondissement

* My favorite north-Indian restaurant (i.e. meat curries, rice and
  chapatis/naans) in Paris, at [Sheezan](http://goo.gl/maps/fHFhX).
* A south-Indian restaurant, also present in India and in the US (they are a
  small chain), near Gare du Nord, at [Saravanaa Bhavan](http://goo.gl/maps/9qTmg).
* There are a few Mauritian restaurants in the
  [Passage du Prado](http://goo.gl/maps/AOiyQ), which serve a good plate of
  food for less than 10€.

# 11th arrondissement

* [Kim and Kim](http://goo.gl/maps/ZlWwb) is a small Korean restaurant, near
  where I used to live.

# 13th arrondissement

* [Pho 13](http://goo.gl/maps/ooFUf) has a really good and cheap Phở.
* In the same street, there is also [Pho 14](http://goo.gl/maps/h4LDq) which is
  supposed to have the best Phở in Paris (but in my opinion, it's less good
  than Pho 13).
* Not far from the asian supermarket *Tang Frères*,
  [Pho Tai](http://goo.gl/maps/kE28P) has excellent Phở and Bo Bun.
* Still in the same area, [Lao Lane Xang](http://goo.gl/maps/E7G2e) is quite
  famous and does have an excellent tamarind duck.

# 20th arrondissement

* [L'abri-bus](http://goo.gl/maps/DG4eW) has cheap mojitos, and good food for
  lunch or dinner.
