[[!meta title="Dr. Joël Porquet"]]

Since May 2013, I've been working as a **Postdoctoral research assistant** at
[UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/en) (Université Pierre et Marie Curie - Paris 6)
within the [LIP6](http://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en) (Laboratoire d'Informatique de
Paris 6). More about my [[current work|work/linux_tsar_porting]] and my [[full
resume|work]].

If you really want to, you can contact me at `joel.porquet@gmail.com` or
`joel.porquet@lip6.fr` or `joel@porquet.org`.

Otherwise, you can just enjoy browsing this website using the navigation bar
above. In addition to being classified into primary categories, most of the
pages are also accessible through [[tags]] and there is a [[timeline]] that
shows the most recently created/modified pages.
