[[!meta title="JoÃ«l Porquet"]]

I'm currently a lecturer at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) where I teach
*ECS150: Operating Systems and System Programming*.

Previously, from late 2015 to Sep. 2016, I was working as a consultant for
[LeafLabs, LLC](http://leaflabs.com/), working on [Project
Ara](http://www.projectara.com/) until the project was discontinued. I was team
lead on the Firmware Development Kit (FDK) and the Firmware documentation for
third-party module developers.

Before that, from 2013 to 2015, I worked as a Postdoctoral research engineer at
Sorbonne University ([Pierre and Marie Curie University](http://www.upmc.fr/en))
where I [[ported Linux|work/postdoc_upmc]] to a new processor architecture.
