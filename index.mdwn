[[!meta title="Dr. Joël Porquet"]]

Since May 2013, I've been working as a **Postdoctoral research assistant** at
[UPMC](http://www.upmc.fr/en) (Université Pierre et Marie Curie - Paris 6)
within the [LIP6](http://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en) (Laboratoire d'Informatique de
Paris 6). More about my [current work](work/portage_linux_tsar) and my [full
resume](work/resume).

If you really want to, you can contact me at `joel.porquet@gmail.com` or
`joel.porquet@lip6.fr`.

Otherwise, you can just enjoy browsing this website using the navigation bar
above. In addition to being classified into primary categories, most of the
pages are also accessible through [[tags]] and there is a [[timeline]] that
shows the most recently created/modified pages.
