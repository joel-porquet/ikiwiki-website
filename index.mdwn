[[!meta title="JoÃ«l Porquet"]]

I'm currently working as a contractor for [LeafLabs, LLC](http://leaflabs.com/).
I'm assigned to the [project Ara](http://www.projectara.com/), putting up a
documentation for third-party module developers.

Previously, from 2013 to 2015, I worked as a Postdoctoral research engineer at
Sorbonne University ([Pierre and Marie Curie University](http://www.upmc.fr/en))
where I [[ported Linux|work/postdoc_upmc]] to a new processor architecture.
