[[!meta title="Joël Porquet"]]

I'm currently working as a consultant. My main project is with [LeafLabs,
LLC](http://leaflabs.com/), working on [Project
Ara](http://www.projectara.com/). I am team lead on the Firmware Development Kit
(FDK) and the Firmware documentation for third-party module developers.

Previously, from 2013 to 2015, I worked as a Postdoctoral research engineer at
Sorbonne University ([Pierre and Marie Curie University](http://www.upmc.fr/en))
where I [[ported Linux|work/postdoc_upmc]] to a new processor architecture.
