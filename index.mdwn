[[!meta title="Joël Porquet"]]

I'm currently working as a contractor for [LeafLabs, LLC](http://leaflabs.com/).
I'm assigned to the [project Ara](http://www.projectara.com/), putting up a
documentation for third-party module developers.

From 2013 to 2015, I worked as a **Postdoctoral research assistant** at Sorbonne
University ([Pierre and Marie Curie University](http://www.upmc.fr/en)) within
the [LIP6](http://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en), a computer science research laboratory.
I [[ported Linux|work/postdoc_upmc]] to a new processor architecture.
