French is my mother tongue and I'm fluent in English.

Since a couple years, I really have got into
[improv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre). I started in
New York, following two classes at the People's Improv Theater
([PIT](http://thepit-nyc.com/)). And I'm now a member of the Parisian
Improvisation League ([LIP](http://www.improparis.com/)).
