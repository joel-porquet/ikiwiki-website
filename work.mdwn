French is my native language, I'm fluent in English and at some point in the
near past, I could almost hold a conversation in Spanish.

In the last few of years, I really have got into
[improv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre). I started in New
York, following two classes at the People's Improv Theater
([PIT](http://thepit-nyc.com/)). Then I became a member of the Parisian
Improvisation League ([LIP](http://www.improparis.com/)). Back in the US, I am
now on the look out for a new improv team to join.

Being quite a computer hobbyist, I also continue learning and programming on my
spare time:

* I was the 32nd person to complete the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/)
  (a series of programming exercises for the Linux kernel - as of December
  2014, 8900 people signed up).

* Between October and December 2014, I followed an
  [online course](https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/inria/41001/Trimestre_4_2014/about)
  about Python programming.

* I also develop a few [[personal projects|hacking/projects]].
