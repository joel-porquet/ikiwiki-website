# Lighttpd and Archlinux

## The problem

Often, in Archlinux's wiki, it is advised to modify the global
`/etc/php/php.ini` file to allow PHP web services access to different location.
We can thus read awful instructions such as
([source](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dokuwiki#lighttpd_Specific_Configuration)):

*Then, adjust the open_basedir in /etc/php/php.ini to include the dokuwiki
directories (php forbids following symbolic links outside of the allowed
scope):*

    open_basedir = /srv/http/:/home/:/tmp/:/usr/share/pear/:/usr/share/webapps/:/etc/webapps/dokuwiki/:/var/lib/dokuwiki/

And basically, the more we add PHP web services, the more any PHP applications
get access to any location in the filesystem.

## The solution

The solution, to keep each web services "chrooted" in a certain set of
locations, is to define a `php.ini` file per web service.

Let us consider a web service named `webservice`. Its PHP files are put under
`/usr/share/webapps/webservice` and its configuration is located under
`/etc/webapps/webservice`.

### php.ini

The first thing to do is to create a new `php.ini` for that particular web
service. To avoid doing everything from scratch, we start by copying the global
`php.ini` of the system:

    # cp /etc/php/php.ini /etc/webapps/webservice/php.ini

Then, we are able to customize it, especially the `open_basedir` option:

    open_basedir = /tmp/:/usr/share/webapps/tt-rss/:/etc/webapps/tt-rss/:/var/lib/tt-rss/

It is also possible to enable the different plugins for that particular web
service, e.g.:

    ...
    extension=iconv.so
    extension=mysql.so
    ...

### lighttpd.conf

Now it is possible to use this special `php.ini` file in lighttpd
configuration. Here is what it could look like:

    var.webservice_url = "/rss"
    var.webservice_path = "/usr/share/webapps/webservice"
    var.webservice_etc = "/etc/webapps/webservice"

    $HTTP["url"] =~ "^" + webservice_url + "(|/.*)" {
        # use this path instead of the normal document-root
        alias.url += ( webservice_url => webservice_path )
        index-file.names += ( "index.php" )
        # special configuration for php
        fastcgi.server = (
            ".php" => (
                "localhost" => (
                    "bin-path" => "/usr/bin/php-cgi -c " + webservice_etc + "/php.ini",
                    "socket" => state_dir + "/php-fastcgi-webservice.socket",
                    "max-procs" => 1,
                    "broken-scriptfilename" => "enable"
                )
            )
        )
    }

The important part of this configuration snippet is the use of the `-c` option
to `php-cgi` which makes it possible to specify a custom `php.ini` file.

# Use-case: Tiny Tiny RSS

Tiny Tiny RSS (or tt-rss) is a bit of pain to configure because it has a PHP
daemon that refreshes feeds, and we want this daemon to also run with the
custom `php.ini`.

Start by creating a custom `php.ini` and put it in `/etc/webapps/tt-rss`. Mine
looks like:

    open_basedir = /tmp/:/usr/share/webapps/tt-rss/:/etc/webapps/tt-rss/:/var/lib/tt-rss/

The configuration for lighttpd looks like:

    var.ttrss_url = "/rss"
    var.ttrss_path = "/usr/share/webapps/tt-rss"
    var.ttrss_etc = "/etc/webapps/tt-rss"

    $HTTP["url"] =~ "^" + ttrss_url + "(|/.*)" {
        # disallow access to apache htaccess files
        $HTTP["url"] =~ "/(\.|_)ht" {
            url.access-deny = ( "" )
            }
        # use this path instead of the normal document-root
        alias.url += ( ttrss_url => ttrss_path )
        index-file.names += ( "index.php" )
        # special configuration for php
        fastcgi.server = (
            ".php" => (
                "localhost" => (
                    "bin-path" => "/usr/bin/php-cgi -c " + ttrss_etc + "/php.ini",
                    "socket" => state_dir + "/php-fastcgi-ttrss.socket",
                    "max-procs" => 1,
                    "broken-scriptfilename" => "enable"
                )
            )
        )
    }

And now, for the PHP daemon, we have to change two things. First we have to
modify the systemd service associated to it:

    -ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /usr/share/webapps/tt-rss/update.php --daemon
    +ExecStart=/usr/bin/php -c /etc/webapps/tt-rss/php.ini /usr/share/webapps/tt-rss/update.php --daemon

And second, we have to modify the updating daemon located at
`/usr/share/webapps/tt-rss/update.php`:

    -passthru(PHP_EXECUTABLE . " " . $argv[0] ." --daemon-loop $quiet $log");
    +passthru(PHP_EXECUTABLE . " -c /etc/webapps/tt-rss/php.ini " . $argv[0] ." --daemon-loop $quiet");

Enjoy! You now have a more secure and rather clean PHP configuration!
