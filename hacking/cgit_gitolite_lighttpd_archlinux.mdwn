[[!meta title="How to make cgit play well with gitolite"]]

Configuring cgit on lighttpd/archlinux is a bit of a pain, and even so when
coupled to gitolite. Fortunately, it is possible to setup a clean configuration
without making the git repositories public (which most of the tutorials out
there end up doing).

# Cgit

Start by installing cgit. On archlinux, the web part of it gets installed in
`/usr/share/webapps/cgit`.

Create a configuration file containing (at least) the following options:

    # set correct urls for resources
    css=/cgit/cgit.css
    logo=/cgit/cgit.png

    # where to find the git repos
    project-list=/srv/git/projects.list
    scan-path=/srv/git/repositories

A few more options can also be interesting, such as source code highlighting or
`gitweb` options usage.

**Be careful that additional options must be set before `scan-path` otherwise
they will not have any effect!**

## Source code highlighting

Install the package highlight.

Then edit the file `/usr/lib/cgit/filters/syntax-highlighting.sh`, comment the
command referring to `version 2` and uncomment the command referring to
`version 3` (on archlinux, the version of highlight is the version 3), as shown
below. Add the `--inline-css` option so highlight will embed coloring
information directly in its output and it will not be necessary to modify any
css by hand.

    # This is for version 2
    #exec highlight --force -f -I -X -S "$EXTENSION" 2>/dev/null

    # This is for version 3
    exec highlight --force --inline-css -f -I -O xhtml -S "$EXTENSION" 2>/dev/null

Finally, add the following option to `/etc/cgitrc`:

    # Highlight source code
    source-filter=/usr/lib/cgit/filters/syntax-highlighting.sh

More on [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cgit#Syntax_highlighting).

## Misc

Other options in `/etc/cgitrc` that can be interesting to define:

    # set title and description
    root-title=Your title
    root-desc=Your description

    # Show extra links for each repository on the index page
    enable-index-links=1

    # Enable ASCII art commit history graph on the log pages
    enable-commit-graph=1

    # Show number of affected files per commit on the log pages
    enable-log-filecount=1

    # Show number of added/removed lines per commit on the log pages
    enable-log-linecount=1

    # Allow using gitweb.* keys
    enable-git-config=1

# Lighttpd configuration

Define (at least) the following modules in the configuration of lighttpd:

* `mod_alias`: to modify the document root in a clean manner
* `mod_cgi`: to be able to execute `cgit.cgi`
* `mod_rewrite`: to create nice permalinks, such as `cgit.cgi/wiki.git/tree/`
  instead of `cgit.cgi?url=wiki.git/tree

And add the following configuration to serve cgit:

    #
    # CGIT
    #

    var.cgit_url = "/cgit"
    var.cgit_path = "/usr/share/webapps/cgit"

    # cgit rule
    $HTTP["url"] =~ cgit_url + "(|/.*)" {
        # use this path instead of the normal document-root
        alias.url += ( cgit_url => cgit_path )
        # make cgit.cgi be the index file
        index-file.names = ( "cgit.cgi" )
        # make the cgi executable
        cgi.assign = ( "cgit.cgi" => "" )
        # nice permalinks
        url.rewrite-once = (
            "^/([^?/]+/[^?]*)?(?:\?(.*))?$" => "/cgit.cgi?url=$1&$2",
        )
    }

Reload lighttpd and try going to `http://yoururl/cgit/`. It should now serve
cgit properly although no repository are accessible yet.

# Gitolite configuration

Gitolite configuration might be the trickiest, but it is definitely doable in a
pretty clean manner.

## Dealing with permissions

By default, on archlinux, gitolite's home is located in `/srv/git/` and all git
repositories there are defined as belonging to `git:git` but only the user
`git` has access to them. It is due to the value of `$UMASK` in `.gitolite.rc`.

Most of the tutorials on the Internet recommend setting `$UMASK` to a more
permissive value (read/execute for everybody, or at least for the `git` group)
and changing existing repositories to these permissions as well (because
gitolite is unable to change the permissions of an already created repository).

But it is actually possible to make only the repositories that are exported to
cgit accessible to the `git` group and not all of them. For that, edit
`conf/gitolite.conf` of the gitolite admin repository, and assuming an already
existing repo called `wiki` will be exported to cgit modify the file as
follows:

    # existing wiki repository
    repo    wiki
        RW+ = ikiwiki
        # make it accessible to the `git` group
        config core.sharedRepository = true

Make sure to set `$GIT_CONFIG_KEYS` in `.gitolite.rc` to an appropriate value
(e.g. `'.*'` which is the most permissive), so the `config
core.sharedRepository` key gets properly evaluated.

Setting this key for new repositories will automatically force gitolite to
create directories accessible by members of the `git` group. For an already
existing repository, the corresponding directory must be updated by hand as
well:

    $ sudo chown -R git:git /srv/git/repositories/wiki.git

Commit and push the modified configuration file to gitolite.

Cgit's cgi script will be executed as part of lighttpd, thus as the user
`http`. This user must be part of the group `git` in order to have access to
the git directories. So add the http user to the `git` group:

    $ sudo usermod -a -G git http

## Export some repositories to cgit

The configuration of cgit shown above defines that the git repositories cgit
has access to is specified in the file `/srv/git/projects.list`.

Gitolite is actually able to create this file automatically. For that, edit
again the file `conf/gitolite.conf` of the gitolite admin repository, and again
assuming an already existing repo called `wiki` will be exported to cgit modify
the file as follows:

    # exported in projects.list
    @web = wiki
    repo @web
        R = gitweb

The user `gitweb` has a special meaning to gitolite, which is specifying to
gitolite that this repository should be listed in `/srv/git/projects.list`.

Unfortunately, at the moment, when creating the file `/srv/git/projects.list`
gitolite makes it only accessible to the `git` user. Its ownership must be
changed by hand to allow members of the `git` group (i.e. http user) to gain
access to it as well:

    $ sudo chown git:git /srv/git/projects.list

Fortunately, a
[bug](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/commit/2515992d8836b2fe333860ad0ed3267efd1cf698)
was fixed recently in gitolite so that gitolite "honor the perms for that file
if it already exists [which] allows the admin to manually loosen its perms just
once and forget about it after that."

After committing and pushing the modified configuration file to gitolite, going
to cgit's web interface should show the exported repositories.

## Further configuration

Additional keys can be added to `conf/gitolite.conf` to give more information
about exported repositories:

    repo    wiki
        RW+ = ikiwiki
        # more information for cgit to nicely display
        config gitweb.owner = My Name
        config gitweb.description = Source repository wiki
