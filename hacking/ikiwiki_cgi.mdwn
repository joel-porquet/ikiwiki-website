The following tutorial assumes you already followed the installation procedure
described on this [[page|ikiwiki_gitolite_lighttpd_archlinux]] or something
somewhat similar.

# CGI installation in Ikiwiki

Edit the setup file of your wiki (e.g. `/srv/ikiwiki/wiki.setup`) and add the
definition for `cgiurl` and `cgi_wrapper`. Refer to `destdir` and `url` to
setup the right paths.

    # where to build the wiki
    destdir: /srv/ikiwiki/wiki.http
    # base url to the wiki
    url: https://yourserver/wiki
    # url to the ikiwiki.cgi
    cgiurl: https://yourserver/wiki/wiki.cgi
    # filename of cgi wrapper to generate
    cgi_wrapper: /srv/ikiwiki/wiki.http/wiki.cgi

Run ikiwiki on the setup file to generate the cgi wrapper:

    $ ikiwiki --setup /srv/ikiwiki/wiki.setup

# Lighttpd configuration

There are only two things to add to lighttpd's configuration in order to make
the cgi wrapper executable. First we need to activate the cgi module:

    server.modules += ( "mod_cgi" )

Second, in the configuration rule that concerns your wiki install, we need to
declare the cgi wrapper generated by ikiwiki so it can be executed by lighttpd
at runtime:

    cgi.assign ( "wiki.cgi" => "" )
